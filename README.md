# POST-IT

We always need to do some annotation to have in our desk or in the some project about post-it also to create some annotations to don't forget some activity to do in the day. So I created a project's post-it. 

* The os module is imported to send commands to the system.
* We add each written note to the notes list.
* We center the text content with the center method of the
string.
* We send the command to the terminal to clear the screen

## To run this project we'll run:

* cd POST-IT
* python post-it.py
